# WETH3074

WETH3074 is a new version of the [WETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2#code) contract
which utilizes [EIP-3074](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3074) to avoid the need for wrapping/unwrapping. In essence
it turns ETH into an ERC-20 compatible token.
